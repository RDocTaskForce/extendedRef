# extendedRef 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Initial Release.
* Includes support for:
    * Static Variables, variables common to all instances of a class
    * Class Constants, a.k.a `static const`.
    * Static methods, methods that only operate on static variables and objects passed in.
    * Object private variables (hidden from public interface, but not entirely inaccessible.)
    * Private methods, same caveat as private variables.
